Preview your HalfmoonUI projects with ease using the Halfmoon Previewer extension for Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Preview your HalfmoonUI projects directly within Visual Studio Code.
- Real-time updates to the preview as you edit your HalfmoonUI code.
- Choose between light and dark themes for your preview.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar.
3. Search for "Halfmoon Previewer" and click Install.

## Usage

1. Open your HalfmoonUI project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a HalfmoonUI file in the editor.
3. Run the "Open Previewer" command using the command palette. (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS

## How It Works

The Halfmoon Previewer extension creates a WebView panel that renders the HalfmoonUI code you're working on. As you make changes to your code, the preview automatically updates to reflect those changes.

## Configuration

You can configure the extension to use either the light or dark theme for the preview. The theme is determined based on your active color theme in Visual Studio Code.
